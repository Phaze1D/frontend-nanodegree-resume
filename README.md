# Online Resume
> Udacity Frontend Nanodegree Project 4

This project was meant to test my comprehension of DOM manipulation with Jquery.I build a Javascript file with all my resume information and then I had to display that information on a website using JQuery to add DOM elements instead of copy pasting a bunch of similar HTML elements. This method is meant to show how DOM manipulation can keep code DRY and reusable.
